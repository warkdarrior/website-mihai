              On Bastille Day, I went with a group of friend to
              Devil's Lake, WI, for a picnic. It was a quite nice walk
              in the park. I borrowed the map below from the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/parks/specific/devilslake/" class="Offsite">Wisconsin
              Department of Natural Resources website</a>, to help me
              illustrate our walks out and about the lake. Click on
              the image to get a higher resolution map.

<h3>More Photos</h3>
<p>
              The photos above were taken my me using a simple
              point-and-shoot camera. Ning charmingly made available
              to everyone her digital photos of the trip. I posted
              them along with my notes on <a href="ning.html" class="Onsite">this page</a>.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="images/DevilsLakeMap-walk1.jpg"></td><td width="100%">
<p>
                    As soon as we got to the lake, confusion started. We
                    split into three groups, one went to park the car, the
                    other two went separate ways, but meaning to meet at the
                    North shore. Ina, Irene, and I followed the East shore
                    railroad for 45 grueling minutes under the scorching sun
                    of Wisconsin, only to find no one from our group at the
                    North shore. Everybody else from Wisconsin was there (it
                    was packed!).
                  </p>
<p>
                    The whole split idea was bad: none of us had maps,
                    and I was the only one with a cellphone. Kyle
                    left a message on my cellphone, saying he was with
                    the other two groups at the South shore and this
                    baffled us even more. I mean, we were all supposed
                    to meet at the North shore...
                  </p>
<p>
                    So Irene, Ina, and I are walking around the North
                    shore, checking people in hope of finding at least
                    part of our group there. Irene spots a car that
                    looks like Kyle, and the long lost sheep are
                    returned to the flock! Kyle was looking for us
                    also.
                  </p>
<p>
                    Happy ending: we met with the rest of the group
                    and had our lunch!
                  </p>

                    After some lunch, some kidding around, and some
                    photos, we took to the bluffs! We went on the
                    Grottos trail for a while, then followed the
                    Potholes trail to the top of the bluff.

                    The walk on the East Bluff was very interesting,
                    with several spectacular views of the lake and the
                    various rock formations that adorn the
                    landscape. Rock-climbers were all over the place!
                  </p>
<p>
                    The East Bluff trail is quite popular, so do not
                    expect to be all alone in the wilderness. Maybe
                    it's because the trail is paved (like a
                    sidewalk!!), but a lot of people, of varying
                    degrees of preparedness, went along.

                    We hung out at the "Chateau" located on the
                    Northern shore. After a lot of discussion (nobody
                    wanted to go get the car), a small group went and
                    brought the cars from the South end parking lot.

              We went to Parfrey's Glen, on the East section
              of the park (not shown on the above maps). It's quite a
              unique view, a humid, dark gulley on the flats of
              Wisconsin.
            </p>
<p>
              On the way back to Madison, we took the Merrimac ferry
              over the Wisconsin river. At the loading "dock", an
              icecream shop was conveniently located for travelers
              waiting for the ferry. We did not need a second
              invitation :-)
            </p>
<p>
              We finally made it home by 9:30 PM, some muddy, some
              happy, some muddy and happy!
            </p>
