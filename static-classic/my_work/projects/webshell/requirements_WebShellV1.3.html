<h1>
Web Shell: Project Description</h1>

<center><b>Version 1.3</b></center>

<hr><b>Changes and Clarifications for V1.2 -> V1.3</b>
<h2>Project Maintenance: Add the "Copy" Command</h2>

	The Copy Command
<ul>
<li>
Syntax: "copy [options] source [more sources] destination"</li>

<li>
This copies one or more source documents to the local file system.</li>

<ul>
<li>
"destination"&nbsp;is always a local directory (a file-system directory,
no html-directory). It can be specified absolute (file:/fs/cs-grad/matz/download).
If the current directory is a file-system directory, it can also be specified
relative ("../." or simply "."). The destination cannot be omitted.</li>

<li>
"source(s)" can be plain documents or directories. Either way, they are
copied with the same name into the destination directory.</li>

<li>
option: "-d n", where n is a positive integer. Omitting the integer
	  results in an error. Deep copy (see below) until
depth n. Value 0 (zero) means no recursion, only the named document is to be
copied. Default is infinity.</li>

<li>
option: "-c",&nbsp;for a comprehensive copy operation. This includes all
linked documents to a (hopefully) also specified depth, even from different
("foreign") domains. All foreign documents are put into a directory named
after the foreign domain (like "www.ucsb.edu"). HTML tags in documents that link to foreign documents
have to be modified in order to keep the links intact.

	  <br>
In the default setting, only documents from the same domain (as the 
	  directory they are linked from) are copied.</li>

<li>
option:&nbsp;"-s", copy into sub-directories only, do not try to copy
".."  references. In other words, never touch a local file system
directory "above" the destination directory. Expand these links to
absolute links to the originally referenced document. Note that this can
	  link to a remote document or a local document.</li>

<li>
option: "-print", copy all (and only those) documents that a web browser would request from
the server when "source(s)" has to be displayed. Change all relative
links to absolute links. This option has highest priority and makes
	  additionally specified options invalid, and it always disregards
	  the domain restriction.

	  <br>Example: "source" is a frame set, then copy
all frames and all images etc. from each frame. Or "source" is a list
of references to other HTML pages without any embedded images etc,
then copy only the "source" document. In other words, one has to be
	  able to "open" the copied document and it looks
	  exactly the same as if retrieved from a remote server, it
	  is <i>printable from local resources only</i>.
	
</ul>

<li>
Deep copy: It is desirable to download all linked documents for a directory,
especially embedded pictures, backgrounds and so on. Two problems arise:
What happens with back-links (loops) ?&nbsp; Where do the linked documents
go in order to keep the links intact&nbsp?</li>

<ul>
<li>
You have to detect back-links and not end up in a copy-loop (A links to
B links to A links to B ...).</li>

<li>
"copy" creates subdirectories and stores documents in those. Say, A.doc
links to "dir/B.doc" and we try to copy A.doc to /local/FS. Then you copy
A to /local/FS/A.doc, create /local/FS/dir and copy B.doc to /local/FS/dir/B.doc.</li>

<li>
"copy" also tries to create super-directories, but it may fail. Say, A.doc
links to "../B.doc" and "../pics/C.doc", then you try to write /local/B.doc,
try to create /local/pics/ and you copy C.doc to /local/pics/C.doc. The
first two steps may fail due to restricted write permissions.</li>

<li>
HTML tags that link other documents in an absolute manner (href="http://server.com/doc.html")
as opposed to relative (href="pics/doc.html") have to be changed to stay
intact when the copied document is opened.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
	
<hr><b>Changes and Clarifications for V1.1 -> V1.2</b>
<ul>
<li>
General</li>

<ul>
<li>
Your application has to be startable with "-gui" for GUI only (then no
terminal output at all), "-term" for NO window popping up. The latter mode
is useful for network connections when you remotely execute the WebShell
on a different machine and you only have a (dumb) terminal connection to
this machine.</li>

<li>
Your application must recognize one additional optional parameter: "-d
name". If "name" is the name of a local directory or a remote directory,
this one is chosen as the startup-directory. In any other case, the default
is chosen ("file:./" i.e. the directory the application was started in).</li>

<li>
The command syntax "cd file:" is used to make an absolute cd to the local
file system. e.g.: "cd file:/fs/cs-grad/matz"</li>

<li>
HTML tags that are to be recognized and possible URLs extracted: You have
to process &lt;form>s appropriately, and cgi-URLs are plain documents of
type "dynamic" or "cgi". An "open" of those documents is not possible.</li>

<li>
"ls" of various links. Assume the current directory is "http://xx.com/dir/doc.html".
It includes multiple links:</li>

<ul>
<li>
href="pic.png" and href="http://xx.com/dir/pic.png" are displayed as ONE
entry:&nbsp;pic.png. I.e. every document that resides in the same location
on the server is displayed without any prefixes.</li>

<li>
href="sub/next.html" and href="http://xx.com/dir/sub/next.html" are displayed
as ONE entry: sub/next.html. I.e. every document in a sub-location on the
web server is displayed without the prefix that is common to the current
directories prefix.</li>

<li>
href="../pics/img.jpg"&nbsp;and href="http://xx.com/pics/img.jpg" are displayed
as ONE entry: xx.com/pics/img.jpg. I.e. every other link is displayed with
the complete server prefix.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Environment Variables</li>

<ul>
<li>
Commands are able to read environment variables, for your implementation
it will be only GUI and SORT that is processed (no changes there).</li>

<li>
Add a command "unset name" that removes the environment variable&nbsp;"name"&nbsp;from
the list of set env variables.</li>

<li>
Whitespaces are significat for "set": the command "set a b c ..." interprets
"a"&nbsp;as the name, "b" as the value, and ignores the rest "c ...".</li>

<li>
Add a command "echo text" that just returns the whole "text" including
whitespaces in the "text" (not the first one right after the "o" which
is only used to distinguish the command from its parameter). In case "text"
is in the form "$name", and "name"&nbsp;is an environment variable, the
value of the respective variable is printed. You don't have to process
"$name" if it shows up somewhere inbetween other text (like "echo a $name"
or "echo $name NONAME").</li>

<li>
Command line arguments/options can be specified for some commands, they
overwrite environment variables. You have a choice of three out of the
following - if I&nbsp;can come up with more than 3:</li>

<ul>
<li>
ls -s value: overwrites the SORT&nbsp;environment variable</li>

<li>
ls -l: list contents of directory in long format, i.e. include type of
document, date last modified etc.</li>

<li>
open -n: to open a document in a new window - if applicable (e.g. it is
applicable for Netscape); default: open in previously used window</li>

<li>
back n, forward n, where n is a positive integer: go back/forward multiple
entries from the MRV; default is n = 1</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
GUI specific</li>

<ul>
<li>
output:</li>

<ul>
<li>
The GUI is split in a left part and a right part: The left part contains
the tree structure, only directories are shown. The right part shows both
directories and plain documents.</li>

<li>
The GUI automatically lists (ls) the contents of the current directory
in the right half of the window. There is no such thing as ls for a different
directory than the current one (for the GUI). However, it still makes use
of the environment variable "SORT".</li>

<li>
Values for SORT (which affects the order documents are listed on the right
hand side of the window) can be set from a menue entry, one "hardwired"&nbsp;for
each of the values for SORT.</li>

<li>
The top level entries in the tree structure are all root directories.</li>
</ul>

<li>
input:</li>

<ul>
<li>
A single left click on the hierarchy (left side) selects and "cd"s to the
respective directory, i.e. it is displayed in the right side of the window.</li>

<li>
A single left click on an item in the right side selects, but doesn't do
anything else.</li>

<li>
Double left click on a directory cd's to it (same as single click on left
side).</li>

<li>
Double left click on a plain document tries to open it (using netscape
or a viewer).</li>

<li>
Holding the right mouse butten down pops up a command window with commands
"open" and "info".</li>

<li>
In order to be able to make an absolute cd, you have two choices: Either
have a header line that always shows the URL for the current directory
(like the Netscape "location" field) and in which a user can type another
URL, or provide for a pop-up window that asks for a URL&nbsp;only on demand.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Shell specific</li>

<ul>
<li>
A shell-"ls" can be done on any directory, even one that is not already
in the tree of visited pages. It is not added to the tree. The current
directory does not change. It is not put in the MRV Queue - the queue only
contains "visited = current" directories. So in other words, the MRV is
a history of the CD command (since CD is the only way to change the current
directory).</li>

<li>
It is not possible to detect individual key strokes from Java without modifying
the terminal driver. We hope to be able to provide you with a set of functions
using native C implementation in order to detect the "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown"
events that you will need for accessing the shell command history. We will
let you know ASAP.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>A <b><font color="#CC0000">web shell</font></b> is a program that combines
the functionality of a WWW browser, like Netscape or Internet Explorer,
with the features of a shell (e.g., a typical Unix shell or a Telnet terminal).
It acts as a client to web servers,&nbsp; requesting files from them.&nbsp;
It deals with <b>all different kinds of files</b> that can be transferred
from a web server <u>and the local file system</u>.&nbsp; It however handles
the <b>contents</b> of web documents only in a <b>limited way.&nbsp;</b>
For example, it cannot parse arbitrary HTML tags or display an HTML document
in a way familiar to you from a browser. Instead, it treats an HTML document
as a directory (aka folder) that may contain&nbsp; documents. Every document
that is linked from an HTML page is said to be "contained in the HTML page's
folder".
<h2>
Documents, Directories, Folders</h2>
A <b><i>remote document</i></b> is&nbsp; any file you can request from
a web server with a HTTP request.
<br>A <b><i>local document</i></b> is any file in the local file system,
that is any file you can refer to via the java.io.File class.
<p>A <b><i>directory</i></b> is a document of type HTML. Its contents are
defined as all documents that the directory references. A document is referenced
by a directory, if the directory has a link to this document. A link is
any HTML tag that&nbsp; has a URL as value (examples are: <b><tt><font color="#CC0000">anchor</font></tt></b>
(syntax: <b><tt><nobr>&lt;a href="some.url"></nobr></tt></b>), a form's
<b><tt><font color="#CC0000">action</font></tt></b>
parameter (syntax:
<nobr><b><tt>&lt;form action="some.url"</tt></b>></nobr>)
or <b><tt><font color="#CC0000">images</font></tt></b> (syntax: <b><tt><nobr>&lt;img
src="some.url"></nobr></tt></b>)). You may disregard non-HTML tags such
as JavaScript links, and HTML links that are embedded in JavaScript.
<p>Additionally, a local document can be a directory if it is a directory
in the sense of the local file system. It is called a <b><i>local directory</i></b>,
and you can easily test local files for this property with the method java.io.File.isDirectory().
<p>Any other document is called
<b><i>plain</i></b>.
<p>The shell always has a <b><i>current directory</i></b>. On startup,
this is the local directory in which the WebShell application was started.
It can be changed using the commands described below.
<h2>
Parents, Tree Structure and Traversal</h2>
The shell allows for two ways to enter a directory.
<ul>
<li>
A <b><i>relative</i> cd</b> (change directory) is when you change into
one of the directories that are <u>linked from the current directory</u>
(example: cd AnyDocument.html). If the new current directory was entered
for the first time, the directory you came from is called the <b><i>parent
directory</i></b> of the directory you changed to.</li>

<li>
An <b><i>absolute</i> cd </b>is the change to a directory that is <u>not
linked from the current directory</u> (example: cd http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~matz).
In this case, if the new current directory was entered for the first time,
it will not have a parent, but it becomes a <b><i>root directory</i></b>.
Later traversals of the tree don't modify the parent of a document !</li>
</ul>
This relationship defines a tree structure which we will call the "<b><i>parent-tree</i></b>",
or simply "<b><i>tree</i></b>". There will possibly be multiple parent-trees,
but only one for each root document. Parent-trees can be interlinked, but
only "on the way down": At most one parent exists for each document, but
a document can be linked from multiple directories. That's why we also
define a "<b><i>Most-Recently-Visited-Queue</i></b>", or <b><i>MRV-queue</i></b>.
It contains a history of the last recently visited directories, that is
every new current directory is inserted at the beginning. The queue may
have a fixed length, such that directories at the end of queue drop out
of it on insertion of another directory. (If you ever need a longer directory
history than the queue contains, you may issue an error message and continue
without this information.) Two commands (<i>back</i> and <i>forward</i>)
allow to change the current directory to an arbitrary entry in the queue
without modifying it. However, if a <i>cd</i> command is executed while
we got to the (old) current directory through a series of <i>back</i> commands,
the front end of the queue is discarded and the new current directory is
inserted right before the old directory (at the new beginning of the queue).
<p>A web shell allows for traversal of the tree defined by this relationship,
simple operations on the documents, and some miscellaneous functions.
<h2>
The User Interface</h2>
Write a Java application that implements the functions described below.&nbsp;
The <b>input</b> from the user has to be read from a text interface ("terminal")
that strongly resembles that of a Unix shell or Telnet terminal. You can
either use the terminal (window) in which the Java interpreter for the
WebShell was started or you can pop up a new window. Your decision won't
effect grading, but a "text-only" application - one that does not use the
AWT at all - is much faster and usually easier to debug. A prompt (e.g.,
">") asks for the next command or sequence of commands.&nbsp; After processing
the command[s], another prompt is displayed.&nbsp; The
<b>output</b> depends
on the display. One display makes use of the terminal that also works as
the input device. Terminal output, displayed before the next prompt, is
the part that is described before the "/";&nbsp;&nbsp; the other display
is a graphical representation of the document structure.&nbsp; This output
is described <b>after</b> the&nbsp; "/".&nbsp; Hint: The Java
<b>Swing</b>
package makes it easy to implement a visualization of both the tree structure
of interlinked directory documents and the content lists of directories
- you have to display both. For an example, look at the WindowsExplorer
(not: Internet Explorer).
<br><b>NOTE</b>: The costumer is familiar with Unix shells and the WindowsExplorer.
She wants to use the WebShell as intuitively as possible, so try to resemble
this behaviour and interpretation - but reconfirm it anyway !
<p><b>GUI input: </b>The customer made up her mind, she wants to be able
to input some commands from both the shell and the GUI. For now, those
commands are: double-click on a directory <b>cd</b>s to it, it is highlighted
in the tree structure and its contents are displayed. Double-click on a
plain document <b>open</b>s it.
<h2>
Web Shell Commands</h2>
These are the particular commands that can be used in the web shell:
<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>cd [name]</tt></b> (change current directory)</li>

<br>The current directory is set to <i>name </i>(which must be the name
of a directory), and the complete URL of the new current directory is displayed.
<br>If no <i>name</i> is provided, the current directory stays unchanged.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current directory / highlighting
of new current directory.
<li>
<b><tt>up</tt></b></li>

<br>The new current directory is set to the current directory's parent.
If it does not have a parent, the current directory stays unchanged. Note:
This replaces "cd ..".
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current directory / highlighting
of new current directory.
<li>
<b><tt>back</tt></b></li>

<br>The new current directory is set to the previous current directory,
as determined by the MRV-queue.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current directory / highlighting
of new current directory.
<li>
<b><tt>forward</tt></b></li>

<br>The new current directory is set to the following document of the MRV-queue.
This can be executed k times iff the k most recent changes to the current
directory were done using <i>back</i>.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current directory / highlighting
of new current directory.
<li>
<b><tt>ls [name ...]</tt></b></li>

<br>If <i>name</i> is a directory, its contents are shown:&nbsp; all documents
that are linked from the it. Special tags or other means identify different
types of documents (directory, plain, or even more detailed). If <i>name</i>
is a plain document, only this document is listed. If no <i>name</i> is
given, the current document's contents are listed.
<br>The output list can be <b>sorted</b> by any argument. This is specified
in the environment variable SORT.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> list of documents as text / graphical representation
of documents
<li>
<b><tt>info [name ...]</tt></b></li>

<br>Display information about the document, such as the absolute URL, its
type and other attributes if available (see below).
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> information as text / if GUI is set to ALL popup window
with information represented appropriately.
<li>
<b><tt>open [name ...]</tt></b></li>

<br>Spawn an external application to properly interpret the contents of
this document. The helper application (aka viewer) could be a web browser
for HTML pages, GhostScript for postscript documents, an MP3 player for
sound documents, etc.&nbsp; Provide the functionality to open HTML pages
and two other document types of your choice. Also, let the <b>user configure</b>
at startup-time of the WebShell which helpers are used for what type of
documents.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing - return to prompt as soon as possible / nothing
<li>
<b><tt>set [variable [value]]</tt></b></li>

<br>This command assigns an arbitrary value to an environment variable.
Those variables can be either pre-defined (e.g., SORT, GUI) or user-defined.
A variable must not contain whitespace. The <i>value</i> can be enclosed
in double-quotes ("), they are not part of the actual value. If no arguments
are given, all variables and their values are displayed. If the <i>value</i>
is omitted, the variable is set to the empty string. This can be interpreted
as a default value in applications/commands that use this variable.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI is set to ALL (this time or any time
before this <i>set</i>), then popup window with all variable settings;
otherwise nothing
<li>
<b><tt>alias [name value]</tt></b></li>

<br>Create an alias for a command, a command sequence, or any other linefeed-delimited
string sequence. The <i>name</i> alias can afterwards be used instead of
the <i>value.</i>&nbsp; It hides other commands or aliases with the same
<i>name</i>.
The <i>value</i> can be enclosed in double-quotes ("), they are not part
of the actual value.When no argument is given, all pairs of name-values
are displayed.
<br>The <b>character sequence "!$"</b> (exclamation-mark dollar) is replaced
at alias-invoke time with everything (every string and character, including
whitespaces) behind the alias name, but <u>before a new line or semicolon</u>.
This functions as an argument to the alias. See example.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI is set to ALL (this time or any time
before this <i>set</i>), then popup window with all alias settings; otherwise
nothing
<li>
<b><tt>unalias [name]</tt></b></li>

<br>Delete the latest (the currently used) entry for <i>name</i> from the
set of aliases.
<br><i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI is set to ALL (this time or any time
before this <i>set</i>), then popup window with all alias settings; otherwise
nothing</ul>
Not every command can be applied to every document. Operations for directories
are
<i>cd</i> and <i>info</i>, remote directories can be <i>open</i>ed
also; operations for plain documents are
<i>info</i> and <i>open</i>. Generally,
one command is entered at a time. Processing begins after a linefeed character
(return, enter). Commands also can be
<b>concatenated</b> by the semicolon
(";"). After the linefeed, commands are processed in sequence.<b> [name
...] </b>means that more than one name can be supplied, then the operation
is executed for each of the documents. An <b>asterix (*) </b>can be used
for the <i>name</i> argument of commands for which it is meaningful. It
has the same functionality as in a Unix shell: "*.jpg" is expanded to all
documents in the respective directory that end with ".jpg".
<h2>
Command History, Attributes and Environment Variables</h2>
<b>Attributes</b> include the document's URL, type, size, and date of last
change. There may be additional attributes for specific document types,
but you have to support only the standard attributes.
<p><b>Pre-defined Environment Variables</b>
<br><b>SORT</b> determines the sort order of directory listings via the
<b><tt>ls</tt></b>
command. Its values are NONE (equivalent to SORT not defined), URL, NAME,
and TYPE.
<br><b>GUI</b> determines if a graphical output is displayed or not. Its
values are NONE, DEFAULT (initial setting, equivalent to GUI not defined
or defined as the empty string) displays the tree structure of directories
and the documents in the current directory in one window, and ALL (a lot
of additional popup windows for little messages).
<p><b>Command History</b>
<br>Just like every other decent shell, the web shell keeps a command history
of the most recently entered commands (either a fixed number of commands,
say 50, or by "set HISTORY number").&nbsp; Given a prompt, the user can
"scroll" through the history by using the arrow-up and arrow-down keys.
On a new prompt, pressing arrow-up once reprints the last command entered,
pressing it again reprints the second-to-last command, etc. The commands
are shown in the same line; the cursor is placed behind the last character,
and a linefeed keystroke executes the chosen command again (using the current
directory, environment variables, and so on).
<h2>
Examples</h2>
Starting from the current document http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/noframes.html,
we can change the current document to the URL http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery:
<pre>> cd search/iaquery
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery
></pre>
Notice the relative path name we used, and notice also the output of the
absolute URL. This "directory" contains:
<pre>> ls
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/ui/icons/srchlogo.png
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/ui/usa/help.html/
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery?NS-query-pat=/usa/NS-advquery.pat&amp;
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iatoc/
></pre>
Notice the slash / we used behind the second and fourth document to indicate
that these documents are directories.
<p>&nbsp;The next three examples demonstrate the usage of concatenation
and aliases. Output is not shown.
<pre>> set SORT NAME
> ls http://www.cs.ucsb.edu
> set SORT NONE
></pre>
has the same effect as
<pre>> set SORT NAME; ls http://www.cs.ucsb.edu; set SORT NONE
></pre>
and
<pre>> alias lsname "set SORT NAME; ls !$; set SORT NONE"
> lsname http://www.cs.ucsb.edu
></pre>
Be aware of the difference between the two following commands. The first
is a single "alias" command, the second is composed of three commands.
Note the output of the "ls" command issued in the second line. The name-value
pairs for the aliases are shown also.
<pre>> alias lsname1 "set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE"
> alias lsname2 set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE
..
SomeDocument.html
AnotherDocument.html
> alias
lsname1 set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE
lsname2 set SORT NAME</pre>
