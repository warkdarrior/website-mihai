	    There are a lot of topics (research and outside) that interest me. Below
	    I list a couple of ideas, and some projects based on these ideas.<br>
<br>
	    Any feedback is more than welcome. If you find an idea attractive, want to
	    extend it, want to work on implementing it, find the idea close to your
	    research or interest, please do not hesitate to contact me. You can email
	    me at
	    <a href="mailto:mihai@cs.wisc.edu" class="Onsite">

<dl>
<dd>
		Many times variables have the same type although they
		refer to different concepts (for example the user id
		and group id might both be represented by <tt>int</tt>
		or <tt>unsigned int</tt>). So what prevents a
		programmer from mistakenly passing a group id where a
		user id argument is expected?<br>
<br>
		One way to separate the two concepts (user id and
		group id) is to give them separate
		types. Well-designed APIs already have safeguards like
		this in place. But there should be a way for the
		compiler to warn when variables are assigned values
		from different conceptual value spaces, even if the
		value and the variable have the same type.<br>
<br>
		How would this be done? I don't know yet, but it seems
		that most cases could be solved, maybe by tracking the
		usage of values through procedures. This is where
		information flow could come in...

<td><font size="+2">X Mobile Desktop</font>
<dl>
<dd>
		Imagine that you could login to a computer anywhere on the
		network, start working. Then you would move somewhere else,
		to another computer, login in, and get the current session
		exactly as you left it on the other computer. Not that
		you have logged out from the first machine.<br>
<br>
		All the windows opened in a regular X session talk to an X Server.
		They talk to a given X server and a given display on that server.
		By changing these two attributes, it should be possible to
		display the running windows on any other X server. Note that
		the processes controlling the windows are still running on the
		initial machine, the (server,display) has changed. This could
		be achieved either by forwarding (i.e., the first display machine
		receives a request to start forwarding all X packets to the second
		display machine), or by actually remapping the (server,display)
		to point to the right X server and display.<br>
<br>
		A central server would be needed to locate and track the last known
		"desktop" opened by a user.<br>
<br>
		Note: Vic Zandy (<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy" class="Offsite">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy</a>,
		<a href="mailto:zandy@cs.wisc.edu" class="Offsite">zandy@cs.wisc.edu</a>)
		pointed to me that such a tool was already
		proposed. The tool, called <i>xmove</i>, was proposed
		by E. Solomita, J. Kempf, D. Duchamp in 1994. The
		paper can be found on the D. Duchamp's website, by
		following this <a href="http://guinness.cs.stevens-tech.edu/~djd/collected-papers/xmove.ps" class="Offsite">link</a>. This
		tool is the right step forward, but a lot more work is
		required. Among other things, I believe that Vic's
		work on transparently moving open sockets (aka making
		sockets reliable: see the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/rocks" class="Offsite">Rocks</a>
		project) is going to be very useful.

<td><font size="+2">{Pre,Post}condition Automatic Elimination/Generation</font>
<dl>
<dd>
		A lot of code can be skipped from execution or even
		compilation if certain conditions are met. The most
		obvious example is the conditionals at the entry into
		a function: they are usually used to verify the
		correctness of incoming parameters. These checks could
		be skipped or sped-up if we had some information about
		the incoming parameter values. The same restrictions
		can be applied to return values, and in general to any
		computation result.
		<br>
<br>
		What I propose here is an algorithm to compute the
		range of values a variable has, and use this
		information to eliminate/simplify expressions where
		this variable is used.
		<br>
<br>
		The programmer would specify the
		preconditions/postconditions for each function in the
		program. I assume that this information is available
		for library functions too.
		<br>
<br>
		The conditions can be automatically propagated inside
		the function, modified accordingly by various
		statements, and made available at critical points
		(conditionals, complicated expressions, function
		calls). This propagation could be done using a data
		flow framework, most probably a bidirectional one.
		<br>
<br>
		Then certain expressions can be simplified or
		eliminated.  The programmer could be alerted of
		non-compliance with function requirements. The
		incoming postcondition should as strong or stronger
		than the precondition of the current statement.
