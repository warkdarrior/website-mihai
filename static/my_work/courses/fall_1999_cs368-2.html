<b>Q:</b>
<br>Why do we need header files? What do I put in header files?</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="gainsboro">
<td><b>A:</b>
<br>
        Header files allow you to share common information among
        various source files.<br>
        
<br>
        For a function, we define the <i>function declaration</i> as the return type, the name of the function, and the list of arguments. The <i>function definition</i> is the function declaration followed by the function body. For example:<br>
        
<br>
        
<pre>
// function declaration&lt;br /&gt;
double compute_root( double a, double b, double c );

// function definition
double compute_root( double a, double b, double c )
{
    double delta = b * b - 4 * a * c;

    if( delta &lt; 0 )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Error!" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 0.0;
    }

    return ( - b + sqrt( delta ) ) / ( 2 * a );
}     </pre>
        Obviously, the declaration and the definition have to match
        for the same function!<br>
        
<br>
        Suppose you create some functions called A, B, and C and you put them in the same source file called myfuncs.C. Let's suppose that the function A needs to call another small function called A1. We can put A1 in myfuncs.C also.<br>
        
<br>
        In C++ (and C), the functions A, B, C, and A1 are only known
        inside the file myfuncs.C. Inside that file, any function (A,
        B, C, or A1) can call any other function. If you write a main
        function and put it in a file main.C, it will not know about
        the functions A, B, C, or A1. If you try to call A (or B, or
        C, or A1) from main, you will get a compile-time error,
        because the compiler does not know about those functions when
        it reads the main.C file.<br>
        
<br>
        To fix this, we have to somehow have main.C know about the
        functions it uses. The easiest way to do this is to put the
        function definitions for the function used by main inside the
        main.C file. So we can do this for every file that uses the
        functions A, B, or C. This is one solution, but it is
        incomplete. What happens if we add one parameter to the
        arguments of the function A? Then we have to go and modify all
        the files that use the function A to know about the new
        parameter! This is cumbersome and prone to error.<br>
        
<br>
        We can just put the function declarations in a header file
        named myfuncs.h (so we know it contains declarations for
        functions in myfuncs.C) and <tt>#include</tt> myfuncs.h in
        each source file that uses those functions. This way, we just
        need to modify the header file myfuncs.h and the source file
        myfuncs.C whenever we change the function arguments.<br>
        
<br>
        So header files (.h) help us share common information among
        source files (.C).
        <ul>
          
<li>for <b>functions</b>:<br>
            If functions A, B, and C, in file1.C are called from
            file2.C, create a header file named file1.h, put the
            declarations of A, B, and C in file1.h, and <tt>#include
            "file1.h"</tt> in file2.C.
          </li>
          
<li>for structures (<b>struct</b>, <b>union</b>, <b>class</b>):
            <br>
            If the structure is used by functions in file1.C
            <b>and</b> file2.C, create a header file named common.h,
            put the definition of the structure in common.h, and
            <tt>#include "common.h"</tt> in <b>both</b> file1.C and
            file2.C.
          </li>
          
<li>for constants (<b>const int</b>, <b>const double</b>, ...):<br>
            Similar to structures.
          </li>
        
</ul>
        Obviously, the rules above can be extended to more than two
        files.<br>
        
<br>
        Keep in mind that these rules are not part of the language,
        the compiler does not enforce them, but they are standard
        programming practice.

<b>Q:</b>
<br>I cannot turn in my homework. It says "permission denied." Help!</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="gainsboro">
<td><b>A:</b>
<br>
        Here is what you need to do:<br>
        
<ol>
          
<li>put your solution file(s) in your CS private directory
            (<tt>~/private/</tt>)<br>
            
<br>
	    If your solution file(s) is/are on a computer outside the
	    CSL lab (your home computer, for example), you can FTP the
	    files to your CS private directory. For more information
	    on that please check the CSL page <a class="Offsite" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/doc/howto/remote/index.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/doc/howto/remote/index.html</a>.<br>
            
<br>
            If you create your solution files on an NT CSL computer,
            save the files in the <tt>U:\private</tt> directory.<br>
            
<br>
            If you create your solution files on an Unix CSL computer,
            save the files in your private directory
            (<tt>~/private/</tt>).<br>
            
<br>
          
</li>
          
<li>open a terminal on one of the nova computers<br>
            
<br>
            You can do that remotely, by ssh or telnet, or by logging
            in to any of the <tt>nova</tt> machines in the CSL Unix
            lab.<br>
            
<br>
            If you are on the nova machines in the CSL Unix lab, open
            an <tt>xterm</tt>.<br>
            
<br>
          
</li>
          
<li>make sure you are in your private directory<br>
            
<br>
            Type the following at the terminal command line:<br>
            
<br>
            
<tt>% cd ~/private/</tt>
<br>
            
<br>
            (note: <tt>%</tt> is part of the prompt, you do not have to type it)<br>
            
<br>
          
</li>
          
<li>copy the solution file(s) to the turnin directory<br>
            
<br>
            Type the following at the terminal command line:<br>
            
<br>
            
<tt>% cp &lt;files&gt; &lt;turn-in path&gt;</tt>
<br>
            
<br>
          
</li>
          
<li>check whether the files were copied<br>
            
<br>
            Type the following at the terminal command line:<br>
            
<br>
            
<tt>% ls &lt;turn-in path&gt;</tt>
<br>
            
<br>
            You should see the solution file(s) required by the
            assignment.
          </li>
        
</ol>
<br>
        That's it!<br>
        
<br>
        
<tt>&lt;files&gt;</tt> is the list of files you have to turn
        in, named as required by the assignment. For example, for
        Written Assignment #1, there was only one file to turn in,
        named "hw1".<br>
        
<br>
        
<tt>&lt;turn-in path&gt;</tt> is the name of the directory
        you have to turn in your files into, as specified by the
        assignment. For example, for Written Assignment #1, the
        turn-in path was
        <nobr><tt>"~cs368-2/public/SECTION2/turnin/HW1/&lt;your login name&gt;"</tt></nobr>.
        If I were to turn in my HW1 solution, I would use the
        path <nobr><tt>~cs368-2/public/SECTION2/turnin/HW1/mihai</tt></nobr>.

<b>Q:</b>
<br>I took some Computer Science classes a while ago. Now, whatever accounts I had there are expired. But in order to use the computers at CS for this course, I need to have a login... so what should I do?</td>

<tr bgcolor="gainsboro">
<td><b>A:</b>
<br>
        Your account with the CS department should have been
        reactivated. Try logging in to one of the machines in the CS
        labs.<br>
        
<br>
        If that does not work, or if you forgot your password, please
        go to the CSL office, 2350 Computer Sciences and Statistics,
        and have your account activated ASAP.
