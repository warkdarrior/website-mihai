    A <b><font color="#CC0000">web shell</font></b> is a program that
    combines the functionality of a WWW browser, like Netscape or
    Internet Explorer, with the features of a shell (e.g., a typical
    Unix shell or a Telnet terminal).  It acts as a client to web
    servers,&nbsp; requesting files from them.&nbsp; It deals with
    <b>all different kinds of files</b> that can be transferred from a
    web server <u>and the local file system</u>.&nbsp; It however
    handles the <b>contents</b> of web documents only in a <b>limited
    way.&nbsp;</b> For example, it cannot parse arbitrary HTML tags or
    display an HTML document in a way familiar to you from a
    browser. Instead, it treats an HTML document as a directory (aka
    folder) that may contain&nbsp; documents. Every document that is
    linked from an HTML page is said to be "contained in the HTML
    page's folder".

    <h2>Documents, Directories, Folders</h2>

    A <b><i>remote document</i></b> is&nbsp; any file you can request
    from a web server with a HTTP request.<br>

    A <b><i>local document</i></b> is any file in the local file
    system, that is any file you can refer to via the java.io.File
    class.

    <p>
      A <b><i>directory</i></b> is a document of type HTML. Its
      contents are defined as all documents that the directory
      references. A document is referenced by a directory, if the
      directory has a link to this document. A link is any HTML tag
      that&nbsp; has a URL as value (examples are: <b><tt><font color="#CC0000">anchor</font></tt></b> (syntax:
      <b><tt><nobr>&lt;a href="some.url"&gt;</nobr></tt></b>), a form's
      <b><tt><font color="#CC0000">action</font></tt></b> parameter
      (syntax: <nobr><b><tt>&lt;form
      action="some.url"</tt></b>&gt;</nobr>) or <b><tt><font color="#CC0000">images</font></tt></b> (syntax:
      <b><tt><nobr>&lt;img src="some.url"&gt;</nobr></tt></b>)). You may
      disregard non-HTML tags such as JavaScript links, and HTML links
      that are embedded in JavaScript.
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, a local document can be a directory if it is a
      directory in the sense of the local file system. It is called a
      <b><i>local directory</i></b>, and you can easily test local
      files for this property with the method
      java.io.File.isDirectory().
    </p>
<p>
      Any other document is called <b><i>plain</i></b>.
    </p>
<p>
      The shell always has a <b><i>current directory</i></b>. On
      startup, this is the local directory in which the WebShell
      application was started.  It can be changed using the commands
      described below.
    </p>
<h2>Parents, Tree Structure and Traversal</h2>

    The shell allows for two ways to enter a directory.

    <ul>
<li>
	A <b><i>relative</i> cd</b> (change directory) is when you
	change into one of the directories that are <u>linked from the
	current directory</u> (example: cd AnyDocument.html). If the
	new current directory was entered for the first time, the
	directory you came from is called the <b><i>parent
	directory</i></b> of the directory you changed to.
      </li>
<li>
	An <b><i>absolute</i> cd </b>is the change to a directory that is <u>not
	  linked from the current directory</u> (example: cd http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~matz).
	In this case, if the new current directory was entered for the first time,
	it will not have a parent, but it becomes a <b><i>root directory</i></b>.
	Later traversals of the tree don't modify the parent of a document !
      </li>
</ul>

    This relationship defines a tree structure which we will call the
    "<b><i>parent-tree</i></b>", or simply "<b><i>tree</i></b>". There
    will possibly be multiple parent-trees, but only one for each root
    document. Parent-trees can be interlinked, but only "on the way
    down": At most one parent exists for each document, but a document
    can be linked from multiple directories. That's why we also define
    a "<b><i>Most-Recently-Visited-Queue</i></b>", or
    <b><i>MRV-queue</i></b>.  It contains a history of the last
    recently visited directories, that is every new current directory
    is inserted at the beginning. The queue may have a fixed length,
    such that directories at the end of queue drop out of it on
    insertion of another directory. (If you ever need a longer
    directory history than the queue contains, you may issue an error
    message and continue without this information.) Two commands
    (<i>back</i> and <i>forward</i>) allow to change the current
    directory to an arbitrary entry in the queue without modifying
    it. However, if a <i>cd</i> command is executed while we got to
    the (old) current directory through a series of <i>back</i>
    commands, the front end of the queue is discarded and the new
    current directory is inserted right before the old directory (at
    the new beginning of the queue).

    <p>
      A web shell allows for traversal of the tree defined by this
      relationship, simple operations on the documents, and some
      miscellaneous functions.
    </p>
<h2>The User Interface</h2>

    Write a Java application that implements the functions described
    below.&nbsp; The <b>input</b> from the user has to be read from a
    text interface ("terminal") that strongly resembles that of a Unix
    shell or Telnet terminal. You can either use the terminal (window)
    in which the Java interpreter for the WebShell was started or you
    can pop up a new window. Your decision won't effect grading, but a
    "text-only" application - one that does not use the AWT at all -
    is much faster and usually easier to debug. A prompt (e.g., "&gt;")
    asks for the next command or sequence of commands.&nbsp; After
    processing the command[s], another prompt is displayed.&nbsp; The
    <b>output</b> depends on the display. One display makes use of the
    terminal that also works as the input device. Terminal output,
    displayed before the next prompt, is the part that is described
    before the "/";&nbsp;&nbsp; the other display is a graphical
    representation of the document structure.&nbsp; This output is
    described <b>after</b> the&nbsp; "/".&nbsp; Hint: The Java
    <b>Swing</b> package makes it easy to implement a visualization of
    both the tree structure of interlinked directory documents and the
    content lists of directories - you have to display both. For an
    example, look at the WindowsExplorer (not: Internet Explorer).
    <br>
<b>NOTE</b>: The costumer is familiar with Unix shells and the
    WindowsExplorer.  She wants to use the WebShell as intuitively as
    possible, so try to resemble this behaviour and interpretation -
    but reconfirm it anyway !

    <p>
<b>GUI input: </b>The customer made up her mind, she wants to be
      able to input some commands from both the shell and the GUI. For
      now, those commands are: double-click on a directory <b>cd</b>s
      to it, it is highlighted in the tree structure and its contents
      are displayed. Double-click on a plain document <b>open</b>s it.
    </p>
<h2>Web Shell Commands</h2>

    These are the particular commands that can be used in the web
    shell:

    <ul>
<li>
<b><tt>cd [name]</tt></b> (change current directory)
        <br>
        The current directory is set to <i>name </i>(which must be the
        name of a directory), and the complete URL of the new current
        directory is displayed.  <br>If no <i>name</i> is provided,
        the current directory stays unchanged.  <br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i>
        absolute path of new current directory / highlighting of new
        current directory.
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>up</tt></b>
<br>
	The new current directory is set to the current directory's
	parent.  If it does not have a parent, the current directory
	stays unchanged. Note: This replaces "cd ..".
	<br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current directory /
	highlighting of new current directory.
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>back</tt></b>
<br>
	The new current directory is set to the previous current
	directory, as determined by the MRV-queue.  <br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i>
	absolute path of new current directory / highlighting of new
	current directory.
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>forward</tt></b>
<br>
	The new current directory is set to the following document of
	the MRV-queue.  This can be executed k times iff the k most
	recent changes to the current directory were done using
	<i>back</i>.  <br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> absolute path of new current
	directory / highlighting of new current directory.
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>ls [name ...]</tt></b>
<br>
	If <i>name</i> is a directory, its contents are shown:&nbsp;
	all documents that are linked from the it. Special tags or
	other means identify different types of documents (directory,
	plain, or even more detailed). If <i>name</i> is a plain
	document, only this document is listed. If no <i>name</i> is
	given, the current document's contents are listed.  <br>The
	output list can be <b>sorted</b> by any argument. This is
	specified in the environment variable SORT.
	<br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> list of documents as text / graphical
	representation of documents
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>info [name ...]</tt></b>
<br>
	Display information about the document, such as the absolute
	URL, its type and other attributes if available (see below).
	<br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> information as text / if GUI is set to ALL
	popup window with information represented appropriately.
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>open [name ...]</tt></b>
<br>
	Spawn an external application to properly interpret the
	contents of this document. The helper application (aka viewer)
	could be a web browser for HTML pages, GhostScript for
	postscript documents, an MP3 player for sound documents,
	etc.&nbsp; Provide the functionality to open HTML pages and
	two other document types of your choice. Also, let the <b>user
	configure</b> at startup-time of the WebShell which helpers
	are used for what type of documents.  <br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i>
	nothing - return to prompt as soon as possible / nothing
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>set [variable [value]]</tt></b>
<br>
	This command assigns an arbitrary value to an environment
	variable.  Those variables can be either pre-defined (e.g.,
	SORT, GUI) or user-defined.  A variable must not contain
	whitespace. The <i>value</i> can be enclosed in double-quotes
	("), they are not part of the actual value. If no arguments
	are given, all variables and their values are displayed. If
	the <i>value</i> is omitted, the variable is set to the empty
	string. This can be interpreted as a default value in
	applications/commands that use this variable.
	<br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI is set to ALL (this time
	or any time before this <i>set</i>), then popup window with
	all variable settings; otherwise nothing
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>alias [name value]</tt></b>
<br>
	Create an alias for a command, a command sequence, or any
	other linefeed-delimited string sequence. The <i>name</i>
	alias can afterwards be used instead of the
	<i>value.</i>&nbsp; It hides other commands or aliases with
	the same <i>name</i>.  The <i>value</i> can be enclosed in
	double-quotes ("), they are not part of the actual value.When
	no argument is given, all pairs of name-values are displayed.
	<br>
	The <b>character sequence "!$"</b> (exclamation-mark dollar)
	is replaced at alias-invoke time with everything (every string
	and character, including whitespaces) behind the alias name,
	but <u>before a new line or semicolon</u>.  This functions as
	an argument to the alias. See example.
	<br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI is set to ALL (this time or
	any time before this <i>set</i>), then popup window with all
	alias settings; otherwise nothing
      </li>
<li>
<b><tt>unalias [name]</tt></b>
<br>
	Delete the latest (the currently used) entry for <i>name</i>
	from the set of aliases.  <br>
<i>OUTPUT:</i> nothing / if GUI
	is set to ALL (this time or any time before this <i>set</i>),
	then popup window with all alias settings; otherwise nothing
      </li>
</ul>

    Not every command can be applied to every document. Operations for
    directories are <i>cd</i> and <i>info</i>, remote directories can
    be <i>open</i>ed also; operations for plain documents are
    <i>info</i> and <i>open</i>. Generally, one command is entered at
    a time. Processing begins after a linefeed character (return,
    enter). Commands also can be <b>concatenated</b> by the semicolon
    (";"). After the linefeed, commands are processed in sequence.<b>
    [name ...] </b>means that more than one name can be supplied, then
    the operation is executed for each of the documents. An <b>asterix
    (*) </b>can be used for the <i>name</i> argument of commands for
    which it is meaningful. It has the same functionality as in a Unix
    shell: "*.jpg" is expanded to all documents in the respective
    directory that end with ".jpg".

    <h2>Command History, Attributes and Environment Variables</h2>
<b>Attributes</b> include the document's URL, type, size, and date
    of last change. There may be additional attributes for specific
    document types, but you have to support only the standard
    attributes.

    <p>
<b>Pre-defined Environment Variables</b>
<br>
<b>SORT</b> determines the sort order of directory listings via
      the <b><tt>ls</tt></b> command. Its values are NONE (equivalent
      to SORT not defined), URL, NAME, and TYPE.  <br>
<b>GUI</b>
      determines if a graphical output is displayed or not. Its values
      are NONE, DEFAULT (initial setting, equivalent to GUI not
      defined or defined as the empty string) displays the tree
      structure of directories and the documents in the current
      directory in one window, and ALL (a lot of additional popup
      windows for little messages).
    </p>
<p>
<b>Command History</b>
<br>
      Just like every other decent shell, the web shell keeps a
      command history of the most recently entered commands (either a
      fixed number of commands, say 50, or by "set HISTORY
      number").&nbsp; Given a prompt, the user can "scroll" through
      the history by using the arrow-up and arrow-down keys.  On a new
      prompt, pressing arrow-up once reprints the last command
      entered, pressing it again reprints the second-to-last command,
      etc. The commands are shown in the same line; the cursor is
      placed behind the last character, and a linefeed keystroke
      executes the chosen command again (using the current directory,
      environment variables, and so on).
    </p>
<h2>Examples</h2>

    Starting from the current document
    http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/noframes.html, we can change the current
    document to the URL http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery:

<pre>

&gt; cd search/iaquery
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery
&gt;

</pre>

    Notice the relative path name we used, and notice also the output
    of the absolute URL. This "directory" contains:

<pre>

&gt; ls
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/ui/icons/srchlogo.png
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/ui/usa/help.html/
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iaquery?NS-query-pat=/usa/NS-advquery.pat&amp;
http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/search/iatoc/
&gt;

</pre>

    Notice the slash / we used behind the second and fourth document
    to indicate that these documents are directories.

    <p>The next three examples demonstrate the usage of concatenation
    and aliases. Output is not shown.</p>
<pre>

&gt; set SORT NAME
&gt; ls http://www.cs.ucsb.edu
&gt; set SORT NONE
&gt;

</pre>

    has the same effect as

<pre>

&gt; set SORT NAME; ls http://www.cs.ucsb.edu; set SORT NONE
&gt;

</pre>

    and

<pre>

&gt; alias lsname "set SORT NAME; ls !$; set SORT NONE"
&gt; lsname http://www.cs.ucsb.edu
&gt;

</pre>

    Be aware of the difference between the two following commands. The
    first is a single "alias" command, the second is composed of three
    commands.  Note the output of the "ls" command issued in the
    second line. The name-value pairs for the aliases are shown also.

<pre>

&gt; alias lsname1 "set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE"
&gt; alias lsname2 set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE
..
SomeDocument.html
AnotherDocument.html
&gt; alias
lsname1 set SORT NAME; ls; set SORT NONE
lsname2 set SORT NAME
