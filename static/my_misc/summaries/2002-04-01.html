      The paper discusses the incentives an agent has to strenghten
      its operation by applying security tools and techniques. This
      comes down to balancing the cost of the security measures
      against the cost of an attack weighed by its probability. To
      complicate matters, the agent is part of a network of
      cost-competing agents, that exchange items that each can be part
      of an attack.
    </p>

    
<p>
      Usually an agent will consider security measures only if their
      cost is lower than the perceived cost of recovering from an
      attack. The paper shows that the probability of an attack
      increases in a network of agents (because the attack can be
      either directed against an agent A, or indirectly through an
      intermediary agent that exchanges items with agent A). Since the
      security measures help only in directed attacks against an
      agent, investing in security pays off only when the risk of an
      attack through an intermediary is small or zero. Thus, one
      agent's incentive to apply security measures becomes dependent
      on the behavior of other agents: if other agents apply security
      measures, an individual agent might still find it worthwhile
      (i.e. with a competitive cost) to apply security measures. But
      if other agents (some or all) do not apply security measures,
      one's agent security costs reduce its own competitiviness.
    </p>

    
<p>
      Open issues:
      <ul>

        
<li>What is the tipping point, where the number of secured
        agents vs. unsecured agents convinces an agent to invest in
        security measures?</li>

        
<li>What is the reverse tipping point (?), where the number of
        secured agents vs. unsecured agents convinces an agent to no
        longer invest in security measures? For example, if every
        agent but one is secured, that single unsecured agent has no
        incentive to implement security measures.</li>

      
</ul>
